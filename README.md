# IIITB_UART_Transmitter -> Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter Protocol based Hardware Transmitter

This project simulates the designed UART Transmitter module which is used to transmit a data packet between devices using Asynchronous and Serial communication.The data length can vary from 5 bit to 8 bit but it must be decided before the communication begins along with the baud rate(in this case the baud rate is 115200).

# Introduction

UART is a Hardware based digital communication protocol used to transmit data between two device at an agreeded upon baud rate and data length.
It used to transmit binary data serially starting from LSB to MSB in the form of data frames with a start bit and a stop bit. It transmits the data asynchronously through configurable and agreed upon baud rates.Baud rate is the rate at which information is being share(in this case information is in terms of bits) (eq 1). Data frame is the arrangement of data packets with a start bit before the MSB and one or two stop bit at the end of data packet.Start bit is a high-to-low pulse which indicates the start of the transmission and a stop bit is a High pulse to indicate the end of the operation.

# Applications

* Interfacing of Sensors and communication modules to the microprocessor or microcontroller
* Transferring data through PC serial port.
* Baud rate generation for numerous applications that helps to determine the speed of data transmission.
